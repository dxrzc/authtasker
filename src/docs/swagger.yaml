    patch:

      summary: Update user by ID
      description: |
        Updates a specific user by their unique ID.
        Requires authentication via Bearer token.
        
        **Permission rules:**
        - Users can update **their own account** (self-update)
        - **Admin users** can update users with READONLY or EDITOR roles
        - **Admin users cannot update other admin users**
        - Users with READONLY or EDITOR roles cannot update other users
        
        **Updatable fields:**
        - `name` - Will be converted to lowercase and trimmed before saving
        - `email` - Updating this triggers security actions (see below)
        - `password` - Updating this triggers security actions (see below)
        
        All fields are optional. At least one field must be provided.
        
        **Special behaviors when email is updated:**
        - For non-admin users: role is downgraded to READONLY and emailValidated is set to false
        - For admin users: role and emailValidated remain unchanged (no downgrade occurs)
        - All refresh tokens are revoked
        - The current session token is blacklisted
        - User is removed from cache
        
        **Special behaviors when password is updated:**
        - All refresh tokens are revoked
        - The current session token is blacklisted
        - User is removed from cache
        
        **Note:** If email or password is updated, the user will need to log in again with new credentials.
