  /api/users:
    get:
      operationId: findAllUsers
      summary: Get all users with pagination
      description: |
        Retrieves a paginated list of all users in the system.
        Requires authentication via Bearer token (minimum role: READONLY).
        
        **Pagination:**
        - Results are paginated with configurable `page` and `limit` query parameters
        - Default limit: 5 users per page (configurable via query parameter)
        - Default page: 1 (first page)
        - Maximum limit: 100 users per page
        - Minimum page: 1
        - Results are sorted by creation date (oldest first) and then by ID
        
        **Pagination rules:**
        - If `page` is not provided or invalid, defaults to 1
        - If `limit` is not provided or invalid, defaults to 5
        - If `limit` exceeds 100, returns a 400 error
        - If `limit` or `page` is less than or equal to 0, returns a 400 error
        - The `totalPages` is calculated as `ceil(totalDocuments / limit)`
        - If the requested page exceeds the total pages, an empty data array is returned
        
        **Cache behavior:**
        - This endpoint uses **revalidation caching** for optimal performance
        - Individual user records are cached in Redis with configurable TTLs
        - When a cached user record expires (soft TTL), the system checks if the data was modified in the database
        - If the cached data is still fresh (not modified since caching), it's re-cached and returned immediately
        - If the cached data is stale (modified since caching), it's fetched from the database and re-cached
        - Cache configuration (default values):
          - Soft TTL (`USERS_API_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`): 10 seconds - time before revalidation check
          - Hard TTL (`CACHE_HARD_TTL_SECONDS`): 30 seconds - maximum time in cache regardless of revalidation
        - The pagination query itself (IDs for each page) is fetched from the database on each request
        - User records that are not in cache will be fetched from the database and cached for subsequent requests
        - Cache is automatically invalidated when users are updated or deleted
